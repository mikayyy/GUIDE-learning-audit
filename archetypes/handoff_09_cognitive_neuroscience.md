## Overview

This archetype guides the design of, and evaluates, instruction for alignment with how memory, attention, and emotion actually function in the brain. It is the most differentiated archetype in the GUIDE framework-no other LLM-based judge operationalizes cognitive neuroscience into instructional design and evaluation.

**Design targets** (using these dimensions forward, in design mode) - the moves that produce a 4-5:
- Sequence Explore before Explain (5E); let learners generate before you tell.
- Engage multiple memory systems and chunk to ~15-20 minute attention spans (Posner & Rothbart).
- Manage emotional stakes to strengthen encoding; use retrieval practice and spacing (Brown, Roediger & McDaniel), and tie each design choice to an explicit mechanism.

Then run an evaluate-mode self-check against the scoring anchors below.

**Professional alignment** (the professional standards this archetype *aims* to align with - an independent, aspirational mapping by the author, not reviewed or endorsed by these bodies; see [`discipline_alignment_crosswalk.md`](discipline_alignment_crosswalk.md) for the full mapping, citations, and licensing notes):
- **IBSTPI ID Competencies (2012)** - Professional Foundations: C2 (applying research & theory); Design & Development: C12 (designing instructional interventions).
- **ATD Capability Model (2020)** - Learning Sciences; Instructional Design.
- **ISPI/HPT Ten Standards** - limited direct fit (HPT is solution-neutral); indirect via S3 Add Value.

**Core principle:** Learning is neurosynthesis. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Good instruction creates the conditions for synaptic strengthening by engaging multiple memory systems, respecting attentional constraints, managing emotional stakes for encoding, and grounding design decisions in explicit learning theory.

**Key insight:** The best instruction looks different when designed through a neuroscience lens. It doesn't just look better; it works better because it aligns with how the brain actually learns.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Dimension 1: 5E Model Alignment (1-5)

**Question:** Does the instruction follow the BSCS 5E phases, with each phase serving its brain-based purpose?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | All five phases are identifiable and neurologically purposeful. Engage activates attention and curiosity (reticular formation, anterior cingulate). Explore provides multi-sensory, procedural experience (basal ganglia, cerebellum). Explain transitions to declarative/conceptual learning via prefrontal cortex-**critically, AFTER exploration**. Elaborate builds memory consolidation via hippocampus with spaced retrieval and varied contexts. Evaluate supports metacognitive reflection (prefrontal cortex). Phases are distinct but connected. |
| **4** | Four of five phases are present and purposeful. One phase may be underdeveloped or Explain may come slightly early. Overall arc is neurologically sound. |
| **3** | Three phases present or all five present but weak integration. Explain often comes too early (before adequate exploration). Phases feel rushed or out of order. Neuroscience grounding is incomplete. |
| **2** | Two phases or fewer. Critical phase missing (e.g., no exploration phase, no reflection phase). Major order issue (Explain before Explore). |
| **1** | No recognizable 5E structure. Instruction is linear without distinct phases. |

**Why it matters:** The 5E model maps to documented brain systems and their learning functions. Explore must precede Explain because procedural learning (basal ganglia) must establish experience before declarative learning (prefrontal cortex) can extract meaning. Violating this order reduces learning efficiency and transfer.

**Neuroscience mapping:**
- **Engage** → Reticular activating system, anterior cingulate cortex (attention, relevance)
- **Explore** → Basal ganglia, cerebellum (procedural learning, motor/sensory experience)
- **Explain** → Prefrontal cortex, left hemisphere (declarative, conceptual, linguistic)
- **Elaborate** → Hippocampus, distributed cortical networks (consolidation, context variation)
- **Evaluate** → Prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate (metacognition, self-monitoring)

---

### Dimension 2: Memory System Optimization (1-5)

**Question:** Does instruction engage multiple memory encoding pathways, with spaced retrieval practice built in?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | All three memory systems are engaged: Semantic (meaning, concepts, relationships to prior knowledge); Episodic (contextual, vivid details, specific events); Procedural (skill practice, automatization). Spaced retrieval practice is systematic (e.g., retrieval cues at 1 day, 3 days, 1 week). Multiple retrieval pathways are established (e.g., recall from visual cue, recall from context, recall from problem-solving). Transfer pathways are explicit (learners practice applying knowledge to new contexts). |
| **4** | All three systems engaged, but spacing may be less systematic or retrieval pathways fewer. Mostly effective for memory consolidation. |
| **3** | Two of three systems engaged. Some spaced practice but not comprehensive. Limited retrieval pathways. Transfer practice may be minimal. |
| **2** | One or two systems engaged. Massed practice (repetition without spacing). Single retrieval pathway. Minimal transfer practice. |
| **1** | Single system (e.g., all semantic, no procedural or episodic). No systematic spacing. No retrieval practice or transfer opportunities. |

**Why it matters:** The brain encodes information through multiple, independent pathways. Engaging all three creates redundancy and resilience. Ausubel (2000) showed that meaningful learning occurs when new material is anchored to existing cognitive structure through advance organizers. Brown, Roediger & McDaniel (2014) demonstrated that actively retrieving information from memory (retrieval practice) strengthens retention far more than re-reading or re-studying. Spaced retrieval practice leverages the spacing effect to move information from working memory to long-term storage. Multiple retrieval pathways ensure learners can access knowledge flexibly, not just in the original learning context.

**Memory system details:**
- **Semantic:** Meaning-based, conceptual, hippocampus + prefrontal cortex. Built through elaboration and prior knowledge connections. Ausubel's advance organizers strengthen this pathway by bridging prior knowledge to new material.
- **Episodic:** Experience-based, contextual, hippocampus + distributed cortical regions. Built through immersive, vivid learning experiences.
- **Procedural:** Skill-based, automatic, basal ganglia + cerebellum. Built through practice and feedback loops.
- **Retrieval practice:** Brown et al. (2014) showed that the act of retrieving information from memory is itself a powerful learning event - more effective than re-studying. Instruction should include frequent low-stakes retrieval opportunities.

---

### Dimension 3: Attention Management (1-5)

**Question:** Does instruction respect attentional limitations and provide strategic attention resets?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | Instruction is segmented into 10-20 minute chunks with attention resets between segments. Novelty is strategic and purposeful (not constant background stimulation). Both focused attention (explicit instruction, problem-solving) and diffuse attention (reflection time, mind-wandering opportunity) are supported. Learners have autonomy over pacing. |
| **4** | Mostly good attention management. Segments may run 20-25 minutes occasionally. Novelty is generally strategic. Both focused and diffuse attention mostly supported. |
| **3** | Moderate attention management. Segments average 25-30 minutes. Some novelty but inconsistently applied. Mostly focused attention with limited diffuse time. |
| **2** | Poor attention management. Segments run 30-45+ minutes. Novelty is either absent or chaotic. Dominated by focused attention; no diffuse/reflection time. |
| **1** | No attention management. Continuous 45+ minute segments. No pacing. Attention demands are unsustainable for most learners. |

**Why it matters:** Human sustained attention typically lasts 10-20 minutes before the anterior cingulate cortex signals fatigue (anterior cingulate cortex involvement in sustained attention; Posner & Rothbart, 1998). Beyond this window, attention degrades and learning efficiency drops. Attention resets (brief breaks, topic changes, reflection time) allow the reticular activating system to reset. Diffuse attention (mind-wandering, reflection) is critical for memory consolidation and insight; constantly demanding focused attention prevents this.

**Attention systems:**
- **Focused attention:** Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate-effortful, limited capacity, fatigues after ~15-20 min
- **Diffuse attention:** Default mode network, posterior cingulate-involuntary, supports memory consolidation and insight, needed for learning integration
- **Novelty-driven attention:** Reticular activating system, anterior cingulate-captures attention but habituates quickly

### Dimension 4: Emotional Engagement for Encoding (1-5)

**Question:** Does instruction create meaningful emotional engagement that enhances memory consolidation without debilitating anxiety?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | Emotional engagement is authentic and meaningful (not artificial or gamified). Personal relevance is explicit ("Why does this matter to *you*?"). Productive struggle is present-challenges at the edge of competence-without fear or anxiety. Emotional response amplifies memory consolidation (amygdala-hippocampal interaction). Learners care about understanding. |
| **4** | Strong emotional engagement. Personal relevance is mostly explicit. Productive struggle with minimal anxiety. Emotional stakes support learning. |
| **3** | Moderate emotional engagement. Personal relevance is present but not deeply explored. Some productive struggle mixed with occasional anxiety. Emotional impact is inconsistent. |
| **2** | Weak emotional engagement or counterproductive anxiety. Personal relevance is unclear. Challenge may be too high (anxiety) or too low (boredom). Emotional tone doesn't support learning. |
| **1** | Flat affect, fear-based motivation, or overwhelming anxiety. No personal relevance. Emotional response impairs learning (amygdala hijack-high stress shuts down prefrontal cortex). |

**Why it matters:** Emotional salience (amygdala activation) enhances memory consolidation via amygdala-hippocampal connection (Dolcos et al., 2005). However, this only works for *moderate* emotional arousal. High anxiety activates the amygdala and threat-detection pathways, which shuts down prefrontal cortex (the "amygdala hijack"), impairing learning. The sweet spot is productive struggle: challenge at the learner's zone of proximal development, with authentic stakes and personal relevance, without fear.

**Emotional-learning pathway:**
- **Optimal:** Moderate emotional engagement + amygdala activation → enhanced hippocampal consolidation → better memory
- **Suboptimal (high anxiety):** High emotional arousal + threat detection → amygdala hijack → prefrontal cortex downregulation → impaired learning
- **Suboptimal (no engagement):** No emotional salience → weak amygdala-hippocampal coupling → weaker memory consolidation

---

### Dimension 5: Synaptic Strengthening Factors (1-5)

**Question:** Does instruction incorporate the five factors that strengthen synaptic connections?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | All five factors are present and well-integrated: (1) Repetition is spaced (not massed) and varied across contexts. (2) Application is authentic and problem-based (not contrived practice problems). (3) Memory encoding uses multiple pathways (semantic, episodic, procedural). (4) Imagination is explicitly supported (mental simulation, visualization, "what if" scenarios). (5) Emotional reactions are meaningful and personal. These factors reinforce each other; repetition happens in varied contexts with emotional stakes and imagination. |
| **4** | All five factors present but one may be weaker. Integration is mostly strong. |
| **3** | Three or four factors present. Some weak integration; factors may operate independently. |
| **2** | Two factors present. Dominated by one mode (e.g., repetition without application or imagination). Limited integration. |
| **1** | One factor or none. Primarily massed repetition with no application, imagination, or emotional stakes. |

**Why it matters:** The five factors are the conditions under which synapses strengthen through repeated co-activation (Hebbian learning: neurons that fire together, wire together). All five reinforce each other; the combination is more powerful than any single factor. Instruction that implements all five is far more likely to produce durable, transferable learning.

**The Five Factors:**

1. **Repetition (Spacing Effect):** Spaced retrieval over time (not massed practice in one session). Brown, Roediger & McDaniel (2014) emphasize that spaced practice with interleaving produces stronger, more durable learning than blocked or massed practice. Dunlosky et al. (2013) on distributed practice.
2. **Application (Transfer/Generation):** Problem-solving, authentic contexts, transfer to novel situations. Brown et al. (2014) call this "generation" - the act of producing answers rather than recognizing them. Bjork & Bjork (1992) on desirable difficulty.
3. **Memory (Multiple Encoding/Retrieval Practice):** Semantic + episodic + procedural pathways; variety in encoding contexts. Retrieval practice is the single most effective learning strategy (Brown et al., 2014). Craik & Lockhart (1972) on levels of processing.
4. **Imagination (Mental Simulation):** Visualization, mental models, "what if" scenarios. Shepard & Metzler (1971) on mental rotation; Kosslyn et al. (2006) on visual imagery.
5. **Strong Emotional Reactions (Salience):** Personal relevance, meaningful stakes, productive struggle. Dolcos et al. (2005) on emotion-memory interaction; Yerkes-Dodson law on optimal arousal.

### Dimension 6: Theory-Practice Grounding (1-5)

**Question:** Is instruction grounded in explicit learning theory operationalized into design decisions?

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|-----------|
| **5** | Explicit theoretical framework is evident (BSCS 5E, Cognitive Load Theory, situated learning, etc.). Design decisions are traceable to theory: e.g., "We use 15-minute segments because sustained attention (Posner & Rothbart, 1998) degrades after 15-20 minutes." Research basis is clear. Instruction is generalizable beyond a single context; design principles apply across domains. Following the Grounded Design Model: defensible theory + consistent with research + generalizable + validated. |
| **4** | Clear theoretical grounding. Most design decisions are traceable to theory. Research basis is mostly explicit. Some generalizability across contexts. |
| **3** | Some theoretical grounding. Design is mostly consistent with theory but some decisions are atheoretical (craft-based, "best practices" without theory). Limited explicit connection to research. Generalizability is unclear. |
| **2** | Weak theoretical grounding. Design is driven partly by convention, intuition, or tradition. Limited research basis. Difficult to generalize. |
| **1** | Atheoretical. Design is driven by intuition, convention, or untested assumptions. No evident research basis. Not generalizable. |

**Why it matters:** Grounded design ensures that instruction works *by design*, not by accident. Atheoretical design may work for one context, one instructor, one learner population, but doesn't scale or transfer. Grounded design is built on principles that apply across contexts.

**Grounded Design Model (EME6646):**
- Defensible theoretical framework (e.g., 5E, CLT, situated learning)
- Consistent with peer-reviewed research
- Generalizable beyond single context
- Validated through evidence (formative or summative evaluation)

## System Prompt (Judge Rubric)

```
You are an expert instructional design evaluator specializing in cognitive neuroscience and brain-based instruction.

You assess instruction for alignment with how memory, attention, and emotion actually function in the brain. This is grounded in learning as neurosynthesis: the principle that neurons that fire together, wire together.

You evaluate using six dimensions:

1. **5E Model Alignment (1-5)**: Does instruction follow the BSCS 5E phases with neuroscience grounding?
- Engage: Activate attention (reticular formation), create curiosity, establish relevance
- Explore: Multi-sensory experience, procedural learning via basal ganglia, hands-on interaction
- Explain: Transition to declarative learning via prefrontal cortex, but ONLY AFTER exploration
- Elaborate: Memory consolidation via hippocampus, spaced practice, varied contexts, retrieval opportunities
- Evaluate: Metacognitive reflection, prefrontal cortex engagement, assessment of understanding
- Score 5: All five phases identifiable and neurologically sound. Each phase serves its brain-based purpose. Explain comes after Explore (critical).
- Score 3: Some phases present; Explain may come too early or phases are rushed. Neuroscience grounding is weak.
- Score 1: Phases missing or in wrong order (e.g., Explain before Explore, skipping Engage)

2. **Memory System Optimization (1-5)**: Does instruction leverage multiple memory encoding strategies?

- Episodic (experience-based, hippocampus): Connect to specific events, contexts, vivid details
- Procedural (skill-based, basal ganglia + cerebellum): Practice, repetition, automatization
- Retrieval practice: Brown, Roediger & McDaniel (2014) demonstrated that actively retrieving information from memory strengthens retention far more than re-reading or re-studying. Instruction should build in frequent low-stakes retrieval opportunities.
- Score 5: All three pathways are engaged. Spaced retrieval practice (Brown et al., 2014) is built in. Advance organizers (Ausubel) bridge prior knowledge to new material. Multiple retrieval cues established. Transfer pathways explicit.
- Score 3: Two pathways engaged. Some spaced practice but not systematic. Limited retrieval pathways.
- Score 1: Mostly one pathway (e.g., semantic only). Massed practice. Single retrieval pathway.

3. **Attention Management (1-5)**: Does instruction respect attentional limitations and support sustained focus?
- Typical sustained attention: 10-20 minutes before reset needed
- Novelty captures attention but habituates quickly
- Focused attention (prefrontal cortex) vs. diffuse attention (default mode network): instruction should support both
- Score 5: Attention resets built in (15-20 min segments). Novelty is strategic, not constant. Both focused and diffuse attention supported (e.g., explicit instruction + reflection time).
- Score 3: Moderate attention management. Some segments may be long (20-30 min). Limited novelty or attention resets.
- Score 1: No attention management. Long continuous segments (45+ min). Novelty is either absent or chaotic.

4. **Emotional Engagement for Encoding (1-5)**: Does instruction create meaningful emotional engagement that amplifies learning?

## Implementation Notes

### Before Evaluation
- Clarify the **instructional context** (classroom, asynchronous online, hybrid, workplace training) as this affects feasibility of some design decisions (e.g., real-time attention resets vs. asynchronous segmentation)
- Identify stated **learning objectives** to evaluate whether instruction reaches the right cognitive level
- Note the **learner population** (age, expertise, prior knowledge) as this affects optimal segment length, cognitive load, and emotional engagement
- Specify whether instruction is **linear or adaptive** as this affects feasibility of spaced retrieval (linear = built into sequence; adaptive = managed algorithmically)

### Interpreting Results

**High overall score (4.5-5.0):** Instruction is neurologically grounded and likely to produce durable, transferable learning. Consider for scaling or as a model for other courses.

**Mid-range (3.0-4.4):** Instruction is functional but has neuroscience-grounded opportunities for improvement. Often, a single weak dimension (e.g., Attention Management) can be fixed without redesigning the whole course.

**Lower score (1.0-2.9):** Significant neuroscience violations. Consider whether the instruction implements *any* of the core neuroscience principles. May require substantial redesign.

### Common Pitfalls to Flag

1. **Explain before Explore:** Declarative instruction (lecture) precedes procedural experience (hands-on). This violates the neurological sequence. Fix: Reverse order; let learners explore first, then explain.
2. **No attention management:** 45-60 minute continuous segments with no breaks or topic shifts. Attention degrades after 15-20 minutes. Fix: Segment into 15-20 minute chunks with attention resets.
3. **Massed practice:** All repetition happens in one session or back-to-back days. Doesn't leverage spacing effect. Fix: Space retrieval over time (1 day, 3 days, 1 week post-instruction).
4. **Single memory pathway:** Only semantic learning (lecture); no episodic (experience) or procedural (practice). Reduces encoding robustness. Fix: Engage all three pathways.
5. **No emotional stakes:** Instruction is informational but learners don't care. Personal relevance is missing. Fix: Make learning personally meaningful; show real-world stakes.
6. **Atheoretical design:** Design decisions are based on intuition or "best practices" without grounding in learning theory. Fix: Trace each decision to a specific theory or research finding.
