# Archetype 5: WCAG/POUR Technical Accessibility

**Purpose**: Design and evaluate web-based learning content, LMS pages, and e-learning modules for compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. The dimensions below work in both directions: build accessibility in against them, or audit existing content.

**Design targets** (using these dimensions forward, in design mode) - the moves that produce a 4-5:
- Provide text alternatives, captions, transcripts, and audio description (Perceivable).
- Ensure full keyboard operability with a logical focus order (Operable); use plain language and consistent navigation (Understandable).
- Build multiple means of representation, action, and engagement in from the start (UDL) - not as after-the-fact remediation.

Then run an evaluate-mode self-check against the scoring anchors below.

**Professional alignment** (the professional standards this archetype *aims* to align with - an independent, aspirational mapping by the author, not reviewed or endorsed by these bodies; see [`discipline_alignment_crosswalk.md`](discipline_alignment_crosswalk.md) for the full mapping, citations, and licensing notes):
- **IBSTPI ID Competencies (2012)** - Professional Foundations: C5 (ethical, legal & political implications); Design & Development: C15 (developing materials).
- **ATD Capability Model (2020)** - Technology Application; Cultural Awareness & Inclusion; Instructional Design.
- **ISPI/HPT Ten Standards** - S8 Ensure Solutions' Conformity and Feasibility.

**Evaluation Context**: Use this archetype when assessing:
- Learning management system (LMS) pages and course shells
- E-learning modules and interactive tutorials
- Web-based assessments and quizzes
- Learning videos with captions and descriptions
- Accessible digital course materials and content libraries
- Responsive learning experiences across devices
- Synchronous and asynchronous online learning platforms
