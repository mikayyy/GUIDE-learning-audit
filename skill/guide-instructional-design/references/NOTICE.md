GUIDE was developed as a capstone synthesis of the author's work in the University of Central Florida
Master of Arts in Instructional Systems program. It applies the LLM-as-a-judge pattern
(Zheng et al., 2023) to instructional-design evaluation across 10 archetypes and 60 theory-grounded
dimensions.

## What is bundled here

The ten `handoff_0X_*.md` files in this directory are GUIDE's "model-agnostic handoff documents,"
reproduced for use inside this skill so the rubrics, grounding text, scoring anchors, judge prompts,
and output formats are available without depending on the upstream codebase. They correspond to the
files under `archetypes/` in the GUIDE repository.

`00_archetype_index.md` is a condensed routing index created for this skill; it summarizes and points
to the handoff documents, which remain the authoritative source.

## Modifications

Content is reproduced substantively verbatim from the GUIDE handoff documents. The only changes are:
formatting normalization (e.g., code-fence indentation), and an attribution footer appended to each
bundled file. No dimension definitions, scoring anchors, grounding text, or citations were altered.

## Theoretical sources

GUIDE draws on 20+ named sources across instructional design, cognitive science, and narrative theory,
including Knowles (1980), Mezirow (1991), Ausubel (2000), Bloom (1956) / Anderson & Krathwohl (2001),
Gagné (1985), Mayer (2009), Sweller (1988), Mager (1997), Campbell (1949), Snyder (2005),
Brown, Roediger & McDaniel (2014), Dick, Carey & Carey (2015), Van Tiem et al. (2000), WCAG 2.1 (W3C
WAI, 2018), CAST UDL (2018), Nielsen (1994), and Zheng et al. (2023). Full citations appear in the
individual handoff documents.
